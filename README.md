# TensorFlow-SIRDS
Single Image Random Dot Stereogram for Tensorflow

SIRDS is a means to present 3D data in a 2D image.  It allows
for scientific data display of a waterfall type of plot
with no hidden lines due to perspective.  Data is encoded to show
data in the Z direction as depth.

This project is based upon:
